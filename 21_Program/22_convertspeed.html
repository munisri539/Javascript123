    <h1>Convert speed km to m/s</h1>
    <p>Create a variable named speed1 and assign it the value 36, representing speed in kilometers per hour. Then,
        convert and display this speed in meters per second.
        [Note: 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s] </p>

    <h1>Print total minitus and seconds</h1>
    <p>Declare a variable hour and initialize it with the value 5
        Then, calculate and print the total number of minutes and seconds present in this hour.</p>

    <script>
        let hour = 5;
        let totalMinutes = hour * 60;
        let totalSeconds = totalMinutes * 60;
        console.log(hour + " hours is equal to " + totalMinutes + " m and " + totalSeconds + " s.");
